// This file is added for completeness, in case direct access to Tailwind's theme colors
// from JavaScript becomes necessary for a more dynamic color mapping in the future.
// The current implementation of `tailwindToHex` uses a predefined static map.

// const colors = require('tailwindcss/colors') // If using CommonJS, not ESM modules for config

// For ESM, you might need to adjust how colors are imported if using a newer Tailwind version
// that supports ESM config, or use a workaround. For now, this file is mostly a placeholder
// demonstrating where such configuration would live.
